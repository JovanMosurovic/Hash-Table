# Hash-Table

A Hash table is defined as a data structure used to insert, look up, and remove key-value pairs quickly. It operates on the hashing concept, where each key is translated by a hash function into a distinct index in an array. The index functions as a storage location for the matching value. In simple words, it maps the keys with the value. More about Hash Tables you can read [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hash-table-data-structure/).

This code implements a hash table data structure with double hashing for collision resolution. It's designed to be adaptive, meaning it can resize itself based on fill ratio and access statistics to maintain efficiency.
